# Austen-generator

This is a project to generate predictive text. I'm using Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice as a corpus, mostly because the free text is accessible, and the language patterns are stylistically recognizable.

The first attempt is a very basic Markov Chain model. Later attempts will probably use more complex algorithms.
